# LLVM final project

This code pertains to the final project for the LLVM course. Much of the code is self-explanatory with the main process running in the train script. This script will allow you to efficiently fine-tune the different multimodal encoders of ImageBind either separately (with different LoRA layers for each modality) or do horizontal expansion of LoRA layers for each modality. 
Datasets need to be downloaded/requested independently due to data curation, permission, etc issues.
